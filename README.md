# Database Design Project
This is a practical and real-world project that puts the knowledge I gained into practice. I investigated and understood a popular publicly available covid 19 dataset on GitHub. WHO is relying on this dataset for it's research. I designed a conceptual model for storing the dataset in a relational database, applied normalisation techniques to improve the model, built the database according to my design and imported the data into my database, and developed SQL queries as a part of some visualisations.
The objective of this Project involves how to build an application that connects to a database backend, running a relational schema. The Project involves the following parts,

Part A: Understanding the Data
Part B: Designing the Database
 - Producing an ER diagram for a relational database that will be able to store the given dataset.
Part C: Creating the Database and Importing Data.
 - Producing an SQL script file
 - Creating a database file and importing the given dataset into the database. 
Part D: Data Retrieval and Visualisation.
 - Producing an SQL query file that includes five SQL queries, producing a PDF file that includes 
 the running result screenshot of five queries.
 - Representing each query result as a graph and including this graph in the PDF file for query 
 result.
 - Producing a report to compare in the speed of various country's vaccine administration.

I created a sound database design with the datasets on "https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations". From this the below mentioned files were used,

1) locations.csv
2) us_state_vaccinations.csv
3) vaccinations-by-age-group.csv
4) vaccinations-by-manufacturer.csv
5) vaccinations.csv
6) country_data/Australia.csv
7) country_data/United States.csv
8) country_data/England.csv
9) country_data/New Zealand.csv

There were many schema conflicts by default in the dataset.
